x oil instead of netrw
x ff with telescope
x telescope jump to multiple refs
x treesitter grammar for comments (rust for starters)
- telescope for completion (wip)
- lua lsp https://github.com/EmmyLuaLs/emmylua-analyzer-rust
- towards using direnv/flakes per project for formatter and lsp server and dont install global?
    o up to date flakes in https://github.com/iff/envs and scripts to setup project (using gha?)
x rename action is again broken in python but not sure why
    x basedpyright should still include the fix?
    x so what changed? does it work with nvim stable?
    x seems to only happen in the trains repository
        c maybe uv2nix setting a workspace?
        ! uses basedpyright from the flake instead of my global
            - see towards using direnv/flakes per project
c offer both stable and unstable vim executables
    c some plugins probably dont work with older stable releases?
x gha workflows for flake update are a bit broken when following fleet nixpkgs
    x go back to separate nixpkgs?
    x at least update fleet first
    x maybe some gha triggering to update fleet once nvim is merged
