! rename action is again broken in python but not sure why
    x basedpyright should still include the fix?
    x so what changed? does it work with nvim stable?
    o seems to only happen in the trains repository
        - maybe uv2nix setting a workspace?
c offer both stable and unstable vim executables
    c some plugins probably dont work with older stable releases?
- gha workflows for flake update are a bit broken when following fleet nixpkgs
    x go back to separate nixpkgs?
    x at least update fleet first
    o maybe some gha triggering to update fleet once nvim is merged
- towards using direnv/flakes per project for formatter and lsp server and dont install global?
    o up to date flakes in https://github.com/iff/envs and scripts to setup project
