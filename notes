! rename action is again broken in python but not sure why
    o basedpyright should still include the fix?
    o so what changed? does it work with nvim stable?
c offer both stable and unstable vim executables
    c some plugins probably dont work with older stable releases?
- gha workflows for flake update are a bit broken when following fleet nixpkgs
    o go back to separate nixpkgs?
    x at least update fleet first
    o maybe some gha triggering to update fleet once nvim is merged
